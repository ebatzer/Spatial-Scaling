Still need to do:

* Quantify what species, exactly, are missing from each dataset
    * What is lacking at the gamma scale?
  
* Random vs. spatial curves seems fine

* What sites to throw out due to disturbance?
  * HREC 1 (yes)
  * MCLA 1 (maybe)
  * HREC 2 (no)
  
* What is going on in 2017, sites at SFREC?
  * SFREC 4
  * SFREC 3
  * SFREC 2

* I think the story here is that we see effects on species richness at small scales, but not at smaller scales
* Instead, when we keep track of abundance, we __do__ still see effects at large spatial scles
