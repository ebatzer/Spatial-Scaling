### Scale-dependence of biodiversity change in response to nitrogen enrichment

##Description

This project details dissertation research on the scale-dependence of biodiversity change in response to experimental nitrogen fertilization. Globally, humans have caused dramatic changes in land use, disturbance frequency, and nutrient limitation. These changes are known to cause shifts in ecosystem biodiversity, resulting in many [potential negative effects](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11148). 

However, many studies of experimental biodiversity change focus on small plots (< 1x1m). The results of these studies often guide ecosystem management at larger scales, even though [these outcomes are likely to shift as sampled area increases](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13151).  

Conducting experiments that occur over multiple scales can shed insights into a number of mechanisms that may cause local biodiversity loss in response to global change that cannot be distinguished by single-scale analyses. This project focuses on the analysis of multi-scale sampling data at the University of California McLaughlin Reserve, Hopland REC, and Sierra Foothill REC between 2016 - 2019.
